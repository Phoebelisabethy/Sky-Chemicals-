        <p class="col">Pericide is a safe and user friendly disinfectant. To ensure product usability and acceptability we have formulated Peracide with the user in mind. Unlike many other disinfectants Peracide does not irritate the skin and does not produce harmful vapors even at high concentrations.<br>
        </br>Peracide has no exposure limit, meaning the cleaning staff are able to use it throughout the day. Peracide has a lasting apple fragrance.<br>
        </br>Peracide is formulated with excellent cleaning properties and is suitable for use on a variety of surfaces such as toilets and toilet seats, floors, doors and door handles, nurse call buttons, beds and bed rails, keyboards, etc.</p>

       <h3>The Appliance of Science</h3>
       <p>In 2005 Michael Joseph, managing director of Sky Chemicals, first became interested in hospital infection control. Reports at the time were full of news of outbreaks of Clostridium Difficile (C-Diff), Noro Virus, Ecoli, and MRSA, branded super bugs which were causing increased hospital deaths, extended stays and temporary ward closures. So he began his quest to find a reliable, effective and environmentally sound way to control these harmful pathogens</p>
       <p>With the help of highly experienced chemists from the industry, their research soon led them to take a closer look at peracitic acid.
       Futher investigations, and discussions with microbiologists, research departments, disinfectant, hygiene and cleaning experts confirmed their findings:<strong> peracitic acid was indeed a powerful disinfectant, capable of killing all super bugs</strong></p>

        <h3>The First Hurdle</h3>
        <p>Using a precursor they were able to produce peracitic acid in powder form that was highly stable, produced no irritating odours or fumes, had a PH of 9 and was safe, clean and easy to use. Moreover it was extremely environmentally friendly as it biodegrades swiftly into, vinegar, water and carbon.</p>

        <h3>In House</h3>
        <p>Professor Peter Wilson a microbiologist at University College London, showed a keen interest in the further development of the idea.  Around this time though, the continued costs of development were placing a strain on the company, so the whole process was moved in-house, creating a makeshift lab at Sky Chemicals, and reconfiguring an old knife and fork press to produce their first peracitic acid tablets, and thus the first generation of Peracide in Situ was born</p>

          <img src="resources/images/project3.png"></a>
        </div>
        <h3>Trials</h3>
        <p>Once Michael and his team were satisfied that they could reliably produce Peracide tablets to a consistent formula, it was time for the first full-scale laboratory tests. Not only did Peracide prove a powerful disinfectant, effective against all super bugs, and especially C-Diff, it also displayed another huge advantage over chlorine based products.</p>

      <hr id='white-line'>
      <div class="row">
        <p class="col">Something Michael observed during the ward trials was a lack of understanding of ratios, leading to dilutions which were either too weak to be effective, or stronger than necessary, which was wasteful. It was this observation that led to another of his light bulb moments; the idea of using a foolproof colour system which would clearly indicate to the user when the correct parts per million (ppm) had been achieved.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
          <p class="col">Now, when a user has added the right amount of tablets to warm water, the solution will go purple in about 5 mins. At the correct ppm Peracide remains effective for around 24 hrs after which it will become transparent once more, indicating that it is no longer effective. At a stroke the colour system transformed the art of hospital cleaning into a science.</p>
